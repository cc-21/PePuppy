# PePuppy

_An interesting and easy-to-use mobile app that tells you more about the dog you love at the first sight._

We built our java-based android mobile app with Android Studio and registered the app on the Firebase platform to use its powerful toolkits. The app utilizes the Google Cloud APIs and ML Kit to label the photos and return the processed information about the identified dog breed.
